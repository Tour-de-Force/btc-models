// A common CouchDB pattern is querying documents by keys in a range.
// Use within a pouch config object like: `...keysBetween( 'points/' )`
export function keysBetween( base ) {
  return {

    endkey: base + '\uffff'

// # CouchModel
// This is a base class for backbone models that use backbone pouch. CouchDB
// documents contain keys that you need to work with the database, but are
// irrelevant to the domain purpose of the model.
//
// It stores an array of these document keys in `this.safeguard`. By default,
// the array includes `_id` and `_rev`. However, subclasses of CouchModel
// may specify more.
//
// Other functions may use `this.safeguard` in their logic. For instance,
// the validation mixin does not consider safeguarded keys in model validation.
// (otherwise you would have to include _id and _rev in the schema for all
// models)
const safeguard = [ '_id', '_rev' ];

// By default, btc-models use the allDocs method with include_docs = true.
// Therefore, we need to pick the document objects in the response array.
